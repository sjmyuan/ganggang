# This config uses the `.circleci/extended/orb-test.yml` as its base, and then publishes the app to S3.
# The workflow contained here demonstrates a practical application of `post-steps`
# and using workspace persistence
version: 2.1

orbs:
  node: circleci/node@4.1
  # The S3 orb will setup the aws-cli and quickly copy or sync anything to s3.
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-s3
  # NOTE: Environment variables containing the necessary secrets can be setup in the CircleCI UI
  # See here https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project
